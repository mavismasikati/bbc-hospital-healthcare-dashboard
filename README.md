##Problem Statement

Healthcare institutions generate large volumes of patient case data across inpatient and outpatient services. However, without a consolidated analytical view, hospital management faces challenges in understanding service demand, identifying high-pressure specialties, and assessing demographic patterns.
The lack of visibility into total cases, case type distribution, age profiles, and specialty demand limits the hospital’s ability to allocate resources effectively, plan capacity, and improve operational efficiency.
This project addresses the need for a centralized dashboard that provides clear, KPI-driven insights into patient case distribution across the hospital.

##Project Objectives
---The objectives of this analysis are to:
---Quantify the total number of patient cases
---Compare inpatient and outpatient case volumes
---Analyze patient distribution by age profile
---Identify high-volume medical specialties
---Assess demand across broader specialty groups
---Enable data-driven decision-making through interactive reporting

 ##Key Business Questions
---This dashboard is designed to answer the following questions:
---What is the total volume of patient cases handled by the hospital?
---How are cases distributed between inpatient and outpatient services?
---Which age groups account for the highest number of cases?

##KPIs Used (As Displayed on the Dashboard)
---The analysis is based strictly on the following KPIs:
---Total Cases: 453.12K
---Total Inpatient Cases: 182.14K
---Total Outpatient Cases: 270.98K
---Cases by Age Profile
---Cases by Specialty
---Cases by Specialty Group

## Analysis
#Overall Case Volume
---The hospital recorded a total of 453.12K patient cases, indicating a high level of service utilization across the observed period.
---This confirms the hospital operates at a significant scale and requires careful demand management.

##Inpatient vs Outpatient Analysis
---Outpatient Cases: 270.98K (~60%)
---Inpatient Cases: 182.14K (~40%)
---Outpatient services account for the majority of patient cases, highlighting stronger demand for non-admitted healthcare services compared to inpatient care.

##Age Profile Analysis
---Patient cases are unevenly distributed across age groups:
---The 16–64 age group represents the largest share of cases
---Pediatric (0–15) and senior (65+) groups contribute smaller but still significant volumes
---This indicates that working-age adults are the primary users of healthcare services within the hospital.

 ##Specialty-Level Analysis
---The specialty breakdown shows that demand is concentrated in a limited number of medical areas.
---Certain specialties consistently record higher case volumes, indicating:
---Sustained patient demand
---Higher operational pressure
---Greater staffing and infrastructure requirements

##Specialty Group Analysis
---When specialties are grouped into broader categories, a clear hierarchy of demand emerges:
---General and core medical groups account for the highest number of cases
---Specialized and niche groups show lower but steady utilization
---This grouping provides management with a high-level view of where hospital capacity is most heavily utilized.

## Key Insights
---Outpatient services dominate overall patient volume, accounting for approximately 60% of total cases
---A small number of specialties drive a large proportion of total demand
---The 16–64 age group is the primary contributor to healthcare utilization
---Specialty group analysis reveals clear operational pressure points
---Demand patterns suggest opportunities for better workload balancing and resource allocation

## Recommendations

#Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
#Outpatient Capacity Optimization
--Expand outpatient staffing and scheduling capacity to support the dominant service demand.

#Specialty-Focused Resource Allocation
---Prioritize high-volume specialties for staffing, equipment, and operational support.

#Age-Targeted Service Planning
---Develop healthcare programs tailored to the dominant 16–64 age group to improve service efficiency.

#Operational Monitoring
---Use specialty group trends to proactively manage workloads and prevent service bottlenecks.

#Strategic Dashboard Adoption
---Integrate this dashboard into routine management reviews to support ongoing data-driven decisions.

##Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Data modeling, analysis, and visualization
CSV / Excel – Data preparation and validation

##Conclusion
This project demonstrates how healthcare case data can be transformed into actionable insights through effective KPI design and visualization. By analyzing total cases, case types, age profiles, and specialty demand, the dashboard provides hospital stakeholders with a clear, consolidated view of operational performance.
The insights generated support improved capacity planning, better resource allocation, and more informed strategic decision-making.
